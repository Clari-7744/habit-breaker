        <summary><strong>Duration Utilities</strong></summary><br>
        
        ##### Utilities:
        * `duration.DurationParser`: A converter that converts input from `1y1w1d1h1m1s` format to seconds.
        * `duration.parse`: Accepts seconds or `datetime.timedelta`, and changes it to a `collections.namedtuple` with each unit in it individually (`duration.ParsedDuration(years=1, weeks=1, days=1, hours=1, minutes=1, seconds=1)`)
        * `duration.strfdur`: Accepts seconds, `datetime.timedelta`, or `duration.ParsedDuration` and converts it to a human-readable string.
          - Example: `10000 seconds` -> `2 hours, 46 minutes, and 40 seconds`
        
        ##### Usage:
        To use the utilities provided in this module, just import `DPyUtils.duration`

        ### Note:
        While this repository is meant to be fairly stable, as I have a personal repository that I use for testing and I do plan to only add items to this build once they've been tested and found to be bug-free, I'm not perfect, and there may be some issues. If you do run into any problems while using my tools, please ping me in [my server](https://discord.gg/EQkDnBS) so I can take a look and get that fixed. 
        Thank you for your help debugging, and thanks for using my discord.py utilities!
